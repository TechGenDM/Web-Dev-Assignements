#TECHGEN_DM-PORTFOLIO

🌐 Personal Portfolio Website Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This is a simple and clean web-based portfolio created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this site to showcase my background, achievements, academic details, and projects as I begin my journey in tech after completing Class 12.

📌 About the Website This website serves as an introduction to who I am, what I’ve accomplished so far, and the work I’ve done. It's designed to be both informative and visually appealing, giving visitors a quick overview of my skills and goals.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I‚Äôm Devasish Mishra  <br>
I‚Äôm a first-year undergraduate at Scaler School of Technology and a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer. <br>
I love turning ideas into interactive, user-friendly digital experiences. <br><br>

My journey with technology started early‚Äîgrowing up around my father‚Äôs smartphone shop, where I spent over 9 years assisting customers. This hands-on exposure not only sharpened my problem-solving and communication skills, but also made me the go-to tech person in my town for fixing mobile and desktop issues. <br> <br>

Alongside tech, I‚Äôve consistently strived for excellence: <br>
‚ú® School Topper (Class 10)  <br>
‚ú® Maths Excellence Award (Class 3)  <br>
‚ú® Head Boy & Head of Departments (elected 3 years in a row)  <br><br>

I‚Äôve already built my first portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and I‚Äôm now deepening my skills in full-stack development, AI, and cutting-edge technologies. <br><br>

üîπ Short-term goal ‚Üí Master full-stack development and build impactful projects. <br>
üîπ Long-term dream ‚Üí Become an AI specialist and launch a startup that creates real value for India. <br><br>

Curious, self-driven, and ambitious‚ÄîI‚Äôm always learning, building, and pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with technology. üåçüí° <br>

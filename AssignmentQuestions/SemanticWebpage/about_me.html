                <h2>Devasish Mishra</h2>
                <p>Devasish Mishra is a passionate and ambitious learner currently pursuing a 4-year undergraduate
                    program in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence at Scaler School of Technology, Bengaluru.
                    With a strong curiosity for technology, he has already built skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java,
                    C++, and Python, and is steadily advancing towards mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
                    and full-stack development.

                    Before joining Scaler, Devasish consistently displayed leadership qualities — being elected as the
                    head boy of his school until class 10, showcasing his ability to inspire peers and take
                    responsibility. His academic journey is marked by a deep commitment to growth, adaptability, and
                    learning from every experience.

                    At Scaler, he is engaging in foundational courses like Web Development 101, Maths for Programming,
                    and Introduction to Computer Programming, preparing himself for advanced topics such as machine
                    learning, AI/ML, and system design. He also has a keen interest in competitive programming,
                    recognizing it as a powerful way to sharpen problem-solving skills.

                    <span>Beyond academics, Devasish enjoys working on personal tech projects — from building a cryptocurrency
                    website to creating a text-to-speech converter with clean, creative design and solid JavaScript
                    logic. He takes pride in deploying his projects using platforms like Netlify and showcasing them on
                    LinkedIn.</span>

                    His long-term vision is to become a highly skilled software engineer capable of building
                    production-grade, impactful applications, while also exploring the exciting frontiers of AI and ML.
                    With his dedication, resilience, and enthusiasm for coding, Devasish is setting a strong foundation
                    for a thriving career in technology.

                    In short, Devasish Mishra is not just a student — he is a driven creator, a curious learner, and a
